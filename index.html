    <h3>How is this different from every other piano roll/sequencer?</h3>

    <p>
      Let's prefix this by saying that I own FL Studio, Presonus Studio One, Renoise,
      Ableton Live, Sonar Pro, and Reaper. While I'm of course not the deepest of
      experts on any single one of those, In the same way that a programmer can work in
      several IDEs and code editors and see where everything's failing, I work in all
      these DAW and see the failing of each of their piano roll/sequencer views, because
      that's the view I live in (rather than recording to audio). While you would expect
      each DAW to optimize for "getting what the user wants to play, recorded, and as
      fast as possible with as few operations as necessary", none of them even
      actually do this. The DAW that comes closest is Renoise, which is basically
      Tracker software for the modern era, with all of the same features that any
      other DAW comes with these days. But even it has fairly odd limitations.
      So, what's my beef, and how does this PoC address them?
    </p>

    <h4>Record when I start playing</h4>

    <p>
      When in piano roll/sequencer view, you want to create music. Sure, it's helpful
      to hear sounds when you press keys, but what you <em>want</em> is to press keys,
      and have those be recorded, at the length you need. That's the whole point of
      opening music software in the first place: to get music to happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      This PoC addresses that by letting you play around with keys until you have something
      that sounds good, at which point you shouldn't need to "arm" tracks, and manually
      trigger record/stop transport functions: you're already on the track you intend
      to record, and the fact that you are means <em>you want to record something</em>.
      By all means, support full-song playback while recording, because that's bloody
      useful, but don't make that be the only way to record when the user is on a piano
      roll/sequencer view: holding your keys down for long enough should just trigger a
      recording.
    </p>

    <p>
      Doing so in this PoC at around the length of a quarter note at 120BPM will engage
      recording mode, with a BPM ticker so you can keep pace while playing. And then when
      you stop playing, recording will stop, too. At worst, you now record "too much", but:
      undo/deleting what you didn't want is infinitely preferable to not having what you
      <em>did</em> want.
    </p>

    <h4>Why can't I move the scrubber?</h4>

    <p>
      Moving the scrubber around in effectively anything that isn't Renoise requires
      weird hot keys, or even the mouse. When you're focussed on a piano roll/sequencer,
      arrow keys should just work.
    </p>

    <!--
    <h4>There are 128 MIDI key codes. Why do I only get 24?</h4>

    <p>
      Depending on the DAW you're using, you'll get either one to two-and-a-half octaves
      of keys, and if you need more octaves, changing the base note octave value means
      navigating to a completely different part of the UI (if that luxury even exists)
      and then coming back to the piano roll/sequencer after changing the virtual keyboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can't fit, nor would we even want to fit, all of C0 through C10 at the same time.
      So let users use their [+] and [-] keys to scroll through the octaves.
      This is literally one of the simplest things you should be able to do.
      And if you're worried about content "scrolling off the screen", _transpose_ the
      input: [+] and [-] to remap the input to semi-tones higher/lower with a
      [shift]-[+]/[-] to go up/down entire octaves. This is not rocket science.
    </p>
    -->

    <h4>Arpeggiation is kind of essential</h4>

    <p>
      An arpeggio line should be as easy as saying "k, until I stay it isn't, every key
      I press takes up X beats" after which you should be able to just run through the
      notes you need to have played in arpeggiated fashion.
      That toggle should be simple, and immediate.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this PoC, [shift]-[1] through [shift]-[8] turn on arpeggiation at a note
      length corresponding to as many beats as the number you type. Type the same
      thing again, or [shift]-[0], to turn that back off. This isn't rocket-science.
    </p>

    <h4>What am I playing here?</h4>

    <p>
      Having to actually <em>play</em> the song just hear the current step's note stack
      makes <em>no</em> sense. Of course, people should be able to start playing from
      wherever the scrubber is right now, but they should also have a dedicated key for
      playing <em>just</em> the current step when in a piano roll/sequencer view.
      This PoC uses [enter]/[return].
    </p>

    <p>
      Related, when placing a new note in a cluster of notes, audio software should not
      play "that single note", it should play everything in that step. It might emphasise
      the note being played, but really it should just "show" you what you'll hear at
      that step, not leave you guessing at whether or not that new note works with the
      ones already there.
